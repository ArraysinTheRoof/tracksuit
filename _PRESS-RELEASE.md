There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

TrackSuit - track your time, accomplish more!

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  You're busy. You're important. Know what you're doing to do more!

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  TrackSuit allows you establish goals to for how you want to spend your time and then gives you tools to measure how you're actually allocating time. Think mint.com for personal productivity. Want to spend more time with friends and family? exercise more? sleep more? Simply create a goal, measure your time, then see how you did! Put on your TrackSuit and start doing what you REALLY want to do.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  It's difficult to know where your time went, especially over longer time periods such as weeks and months with a high degree of accuracy. Even when people have a general sense of how they spent their time and how they want to spend their time, the ability to track and benchmark time cannot be done in an accurate and SMART way (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, time-bound). TrackSuit enables users to track time more accurately and create goals to keep them accountable.


## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  Provide users with the means to track time, benchmark time, and get insights into how spent was spent over any time period.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  Your time is yours. Spend it how you REALLY want.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  1) Choose an activity category. E.g. sleep
  2) Create a goal. E.g. sleep 8 hours.
  3) Measure your time. Slept 6 hours.
  4) See how you did!

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "I knew I was working way too much and not spending enough time with my family. Once I started using TrackSuit, I was able to see how I really allocated my time. TrackSuit has helped me to spend my time in a way that's most valuable to me."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
